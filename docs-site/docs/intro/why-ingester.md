# Why use Ingester?

## The Problem

Walrus stores data as unstructured blobs, leaving developers to manually organize and relate them.
Today, ingestion is fragmented — each team builds its own solution. This slows adoption and introduces avoidable technical hurdles.

## The Solution

Ingester brings structure and automation to Walrus:

- Automatically organizes blobs using a metadata-driven approach

- Integrates out-of-the-box with sources like AWS S3 (more coming in the future)

- Enables a plug-and-play developer experience — no need to reinvent ingestion pipelines

## Value Proposition

Ingester solves two key challenges for teams using Walrus:

- Adds structure: Turns scattered blobs into connected, queryable data by using metadata files after ingestion.

- Removes friction: Provides ready-made ingestion flows to save time and reduce complexity

With Ingester, Walrus becomes a developer-friendly, ready-to-use storage platform — accelerating adoption and unlocking the full potential of decentralized storage.
