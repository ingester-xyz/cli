# Why use Ingester?

## The Problem

Walrus stores data as individual blobs, without inherent structure.

Developers struggle to manage and relate these blobs meaningfully.

Ingesting data into Walrus today is manual and fragmented — each team must build its own solution.

This slows adoption and creates unnecessary technical barriers.

## The Solution

Provides an automatic, schema-driven structure over Walrus blobs.

Offers ready-made integrations (AWS S3, and more) to simplify ingestion.

Delivers a plug-and-play experience where developers can just use Walrus, without reinventing ingestion pipelines.

Frees teams from worrying about data relationships or implementation details — it just works.

## Value Proposition

Ingester simplifies how teams use Walrus by solving two critical problems:

- It adds structure — turning scattered blobs into organized, connected data, so developers don’t have to figure it out themselves.

- It removes friction — offering ready-to-use integrations that make ingesting data easy, saving teams from wasting time building custom solutions.

With Ingester, Walrus becomes a plug-and-play, developer-friendly storage platform, accelerating adoption across diverse industries and unlocking the full potential of decentralized storage.
