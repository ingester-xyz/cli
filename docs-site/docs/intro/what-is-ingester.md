# What is Ingester?

**Ingester** is a Go-based CLI tool that makes ingesting data into Walrus seamless and predictable.

In its first iteration, it focuses on migrating existing data from _AWS S3_ into Walrus. Along the way, it generates a metadata file that enables efficient search operations (e.g., `list` or `get`), similar to the native behavior of AWS S3. This simplifies the management of large volumes of blobs stored in Walrus.

In the future, more integrations are ready to come (e.g. Arweave -> Walrus).

## Context

Today, Walrus stores data as scattered blobs, with no built-in structure, and ingesting data into it is a manual, fragmented process.
As a result, every team has to build their own solution.

Ingester solves these two critical pain points by:

- Adding an automatic, schema-driven structure that organizes and relates blobs predictably.

- Providing ready-to-use integrations (like AWS S3) so teams can easily ingest data without extra development effort.

With Ingester, Walrus transforms from a raw storage system into a plug-and-play, developer-friendly platform.
Therefore accelerating adoption, reducing barriers, and unlocking its full potential across real-world use cases.
